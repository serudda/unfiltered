I've been in tech for 15 years. Built products used by [thousands](https://www.uiguideline.com). But here's my secret: I can't write.

Not false modesty. Real fear.

Walking down the street, every time an idea hit me (something to share on Twitter or my newsletter), I'd save it in a note. Where it died. Because the next step was "structure it properly," and that step never came.

My favorite excuse: "Someday I'll learn to write better." That day never came.

Years of the same pattern. Years of lost opportunities to share what's in my head, all because I feared the judgment: "This guy's been in the industry for 15 years, calls himself a Senior Product Engineer, and can't articulate his ideas?" That paralyzed me.

But in 2026, something changed.

I didn't learn to write. The tech caught up.

Now I have what I always imagined: that secretary from old movies, sitting at a desk typing everything the boss dictates. But in my pocket. Available while I walk, while I cook, while ideas hit me at 3am.

I give it my raw ideas (redundant, messy, visceral), and it turns them into something publishable.

A pocket writer.

I can finally express what I think without fear of judgment.

If you have ideas trapped like I did, waiting for the day you "learn to write"... let me tell you: with a simple setup on your phone and Claude Code, you can start now. No fear.

I opened this newsletter to kill that fear. I'll share my progress here (thoughts, wins, fears, frustrations).

If you want to know how I set this up, let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/serudda).
