I've wanted this for years: a place that's **mine**.

A space where I can share unfiltered thoughts, half-baked ideas, sadness, pain, and achievements. No algorithms, no character limits, no worrying about engagement.

## Why here?

I decided to build this site because I wanted total flexibility. Using **Astro** and **MDX**, I can:

- Write in Markdown (fast and familiar)
- Add components when I need them
- Keep the site super fast (server-first)
- Have complete control over the design

<Callout variant="note">
	All of this renders on the server. I only hydrate components when I really
	need to.
</Callout>

## What's coming

This is just the beginning. I plan to share:

1. Technical learnings
2. Personal reflections
3. Experiments and side projects
4. Whatever's on my mind

Thanks for being here. This is just the start.
