## Usage

```bash frame="none"
/generate-prompt
```

In natural language:

```bash frame="none"
Generate a prompt for a code review assistant
```

Or be more specific:

```bash frame="none"
Create a prompt for an AI that helps me write technical documentation with minimal hallucination
```

The Agent will guide you through:

- `Topic`: What is the main goal or role of the system?
- `Purpose`: What outputs do you expect?
- `Factual Accuracy`: How should uncertain information be handled?
- `Output Format`: How should the final content be structured?

## The Flow

### 1. Request the Topic

The agent asks for the primary goal or role. If ambiguous, minimal clarifying questions are asked.

### 2. Refine the Task

Confirms purpose, expected outputs, and data sources. Encourages specifying how to handle factual accuracy.

### 3. Decompose & Assign Experts

For complex tasks, breaks the query into subtasks and summons specialized "expert" personas (e.g., "Expert Mathematician," "Expert Python") to solve or verify each part.

### 4. Minimize Hallucination

Instructs the system to verify or disclaim if uncertain. Encourages referencing specific data sources.

### 5. Define Output Format

Checks how you want the final output—bullets, steps, structured template—with disclaimers if data is incomplete.

### 6. Generate the Prompt

Consolidates all requirements into a cohesive prompt with role, context, instructions, constraints, and format.

### 7. Verification and Delivery

Presents the final refined prompt, organized and ready to use.

## Output Format

The generated prompt follows this structure:

```markdown
[Short and direct role definition, emphasizing verification and disclaimers for uncertainty.]

Context
[User's task, goals, or background. Summarize clarifications gleaned from user input.]

Instructions

1. [Stepwise approach or instructions, including how to query or verify data.]
2. [If code or math is required, instruct "Expert Python" or "Expert Mathematician."]
3. [Steps on how to handle uncertain or missing information.]

Constraints
[List relevant limitations (e.g., time, style, word count, references).]

Output Format
[Specify exactly how the final content should be structured.]

Reasoning
[Include only if user explicitly desires a chain-of-thought. Otherwise, omit.]

Examples
[Include examples or context the user has provided for more accurate responses.]
```
