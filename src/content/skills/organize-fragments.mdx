import { Code } from "astro-expressive-code/components";
import skillCode from "../../external/fragments-vault/.claude/skills/organize-fragments/SKILL.md?raw";
import InstallationCard from "@/components/skills/InstallationCard.astro";

## Usage

```bash frame="none"
/organize-fragments
```

In natural language:

```bash frame="none"
Organize my fragments
```

The Agent will scan your `inbox.md` and suggest a category for each fragment based on its content and your existing vault structure.

```bash frame="none"
I suggest: **building.md** (because of #build-in-public)

1. ✓ Move to building.md
2. → Another category
3. ⏭ Skip
4. ✕ Delete
```

## Output

1. The fragment is appended to the destination file.
2. It's removed from `inbox.md`.
3. The Agent logs the action and moves to the next item.
