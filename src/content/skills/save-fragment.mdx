## What is Save Fragment?

Save Fragment is a Claude Code skill that lets you quickly capture any piece of knowledge worth remembering. Whether it's a quote from a book, an insightful tweet, or a paragraph from an article, you can save it instantly with full attribution.

## How to Use

Use the `/save-fragment` command followed by the content you want to save:

```bash frame="none"
/save-fragment "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now." --source "Chinese Proverb" --tags wisdom, time
```

### Parameters

| Parameter    | Required | Description                             |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `content`    | Yes      | The text content to save (in quotes)    |
| `--source`   | No       | Attribution for the fragment            |
| `--tags`     | No       | Comma-separated tags for categorization |
| `--category` | No       | Main category (defaults to "inbox")     |

### Examples

**Save a book quote:**

```bash frame="none"
/save-fragment "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." --source "Aristotle" --tags philosophy, habits
```

**Save a code snippet:**

```bash frame="none"
/save-fragment "const sum = arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)" --source "JavaScript patterns" --tags javascript, snippets --category code
```

## Output

The skill saves the fragment to your configured storage location (default: `~/Documents/fragments.md`) in a structured format:

```markdown
## Fragment #42

> The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.

**Source:** Chinese Proverb  
**Tags:** #wisdom #time  
**Saved:** 2025-01-15
