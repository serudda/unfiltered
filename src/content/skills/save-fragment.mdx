import skillCode from "../../external/fragments-vault/.claude/skills/save-fragment/SKILL.md?raw";

## Usage

```bash frame="none"
/save-fragment "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."
```

In natural language:

```bash frame="none"
Save this fragment: "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."
```

The Agent will ask you for:

- `Author`: Who said/who wrote it?
- `Source`: Where does it come from? _(author, book, tweet, article)_
- `Tags`: It will show you existing tags and suggest some
- `Why`: Why did it catch your attention? _(Important when Agent is searching fragments to connect knowledge points)_

## Output

Everything goes to `inbox.md` first, in a structured format (you can then organize it later):
