## What is Fragments?

Fragments is a Claude Code vault that helps you build and search your personal knowledge collection. Every time you read something worth remembering—a quote from a book, an insightful tweet, a paragraph from an article—you can save it with this set of skills.

Think of it as your personal `knowledge.md` file, but searchable and organized. Use it to capture insights, track ideas as they come, or store that perfect quote you'll need later.

## Getting Started

This vault includes three skills that work together:

1. **Save Fragment** – Capture any piece of knowledge instantly
2. **Organize Fragments** – Keep your vault tidy and well-categorized
3. **Browse Fragments** – Find exactly what you need when you need it

## Usage

1. Para guardar un fragmento de texto, quote, snippet, etc. invoca el skill `save-fragment`:

```bash frame="none"
/save-fragment "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."
```

En lenguaje natural:

```bash frame="none"
Guarda este fragmento: "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."
```

El Agent te preguntara por:

- `Author` — Who said/who wrote it?
- `Source` — Where does it come from? (author, book, tweet, article)
- `Tags` — It will show you existing tags and suggest some
- `Why` — Why did it catch your attention? (Importante para dar más contexto al Skill, al momento de buscar o conectar puntos de conocimiento)

Everything goes to `inbox.md` first. You can then organize it later.

2. Para organizar tus fragmentos invoca el skill `organize-fragments`:

```bash frame="none"
/organize-fragments
```

En lenguaje natural:

```bash frame="none"
Organiza mis fragmentos
```

El Agent te sugerira una categoría para cada fragmento.

```bash frame="none"
I suggest: **building.md** (because of #build-in-public)

1. ✓ Move to building.md
2. → Another category
3. ⏭ Skip
4. ✕ Delete
```

Al responder, el Agent appends fragment to destination file, removes from `inbox.md`, and confirms the action.

## Installation

To install this vault in Claude Code, add each skill to your `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash frame="none"
cp save-fragment.md ~/.claude/skills/
cp organize-fragments.md ~/.claude/skills/
cp browse-fragments.md ~/.claude/skills/
```

Or install the entire vault at once:

```bash frame="none"
cp -r fragments/ ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Configuration

The vault stores fragments in a local markdown file. You can configure the storage location in your Claude settings:

```yaml
fragments:
  storage: ~/Documents/fragments.md
  defaultTags: []
  categories:
    - inbox
    - quotes
    - ideas
    - references
    - code
```

## Why Use Fragments?

- **Never lose a good idea again** – Capture thoughts instantly while reading, studying, coding, etc.
- **Build your second brain** – Create a searchable knowledge base over time.
- **Stay in flow** – No interrupting your flow to save a text fragment.
