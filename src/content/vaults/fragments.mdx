## What is Fragments?

Fragments is a Claude Code vault that helps you build and search your personal knowledge collection. Every time you read something worth remembering—a quote from a book, an insightful tweet, a paragraph from an article—you can save it with this set of skills.

Think of it as your personal `knowledge.md` file, but searchable and organized. Use it to capture insights, track `const ideas = []` as they come, or store that perfect quote you'll need later.

## How to Use

You can interact with Fragments using simple commands. Each skill in this vault handles a specific part of your workflow.

### Save a new fragment

Use the `save` command to add a new fragment to your vault:

```bash frame="none"
/fragments save "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now." --source "Chinese Proverb" --tags wisdom, time
```

### Organize your fragments

Move fragments from your inbox to their proper categories:

```bash frame="none"
/fragments organize
```

### Search your fragments

Looking for that quote about trees? Use the `browse` command:

```bash frame="none"
/fragments browse trees
```

### Browse by tag

Filter fragments by tag:

```bash frame="none"
/fragments browse --tag wisdom
```

Pro tip: You can also use `--format json` to get machine-readable output.

## Installation

To install this vault in Claude Code, add it to your `.claude/skills/` directory or reference it in your configuration.

```bash frame="none"
cp fragments.md ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Example: README.md file

Here's an example of a project documentation file imported dynamically:

<Code code={readmeContent} lang="markdown" title="README.md" frame="none" />

## Configuration

The vault stores fragments in a local markdown file. You can configure the storage location:

```yaml
fragments:
  storage: ~/Documents/fragments.md
  defaultTags: []
```
