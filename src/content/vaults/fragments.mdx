## What is Fragments?

Fragments is a Claude Code vault that helps you build and search your personal knowledge collection. Every time you read something worth remembering—a quote from a book, an insightful tweet, a paragraph from an article—you can save it with this set of skills.

Think of it as your personal `knowledge.md` file, but searchable and organized. Use it to capture insights, track ideas as they come, or store that perfect quote you'll need later.

## Getting Started

This vault includes three skills that work together:

1. **Save Fragment** – Capture any piece of knowledge instantly
2. **Organize Fragments** – Keep your vault tidy and well-categorized
3. **Browse Fragments** – Find exactly what you need when you need it

## Quick Example

```bash frame="none"
# Save a new fragment
/save-fragment "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now." --source "Chinese Proverb" --tags wisdom, time

# Search your fragments
/browse-fragments trees

# Organize your inbox
/organize-fragments --inbox-only
```

## Installation

To install this vault in Claude Code, add each skill to your `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash frame="none"
cp save-fragment.md ~/.claude/skills/
cp organize-fragments.md ~/.claude/skills/
cp browse-fragments.md ~/.claude/skills/
```

Or install the entire vault at once:

```bash frame="none"
cp -r fragments/ ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Configuration

The vault stores fragments in a local markdown file. You can configure the storage location in your Claude settings:

```yaml
fragments:
  storage: ~/Documents/fragments.md
  defaultTags: []
  categories:
    - inbox
    - quotes
    - ideas
    - references
    - code
```

## Why Use Fragments?

- **Never lose a good idea again** – Capture thoughts instantly while coding
- **Build your second brain** – Create a searchable knowledge base over time
- **Stay in flow** – Quick commands mean minimal context switching
- **Everything in one place** – Books, tweets, articles, code—all searchable
