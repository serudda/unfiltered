## Folder Structure

```text frame="none"
fragments/
├── inbox.md         # Where everything arrives (unprocessed)
├── career.md        # (Example) Work, money, negotiation, employers
├── building.md      # (Example) Side projects, indie hacking, startups
└── life.md          # (Example) Philosophy, values, relationships, decisions
```

## Usage

### 1. Save a Fragment

To save a text fragment, quote, snippet, etc., invoke the save-fragment skill:

```bash frame="none"
/save-fragment "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."
```

In natural language:

```bash frame="none"
Save this fragment: "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."
```

The Agent will ask you for:

- `Author`: Who said/who wrote it?
- `Source`: Where does it come from? _(author, book, tweet, article)_
- `Tags`: It will show you existing tags and suggest some
- `Why`: Why did it catch your attention? _(Important when Agent is searching fragments to connect knowledge points)_

Everything goes to `inbox.md` first. You can then organize it later.

### 2. To organize your fragments, invoke the `organize-fragments` skill:

```bash frame="none"
/organize-fragments
```

In natural language:

```bash frame="none"
Organize my fragments
```

The Agent will suggest a category for each fragment.

```bash frame="none"
I suggest: **building.md** (because of #build-in-public)

1. ✓ Move to building.md
2. → Another category
3. ⏭ Skip
4. ✕ Delete
```

When you respond, the Agent appends the fragment to the destination file _(category)_, removes it from `inbox.md`, and confirms the action.

## Installation

To install this vault in Claude Code, add each skill to your `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash frame="none"
cp save-fragment.md ~/.claude/skills/
cp organize-fragments.md ~/.claude/skills/
cp browse-fragments.md ~/.claude/skills/
```

Or install the entire vault at once:

```bash frame="none"
cp -r fragments/ ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Why Use Fragments?

- **Never lose a good idea again** – Capture thoughts instantly while reading, studying, coding, etc.
- **Build your second brain** – Create a searchable knowledge base over time.
- **Stay in flow** – No interrupting your flow to save a text fragment.
